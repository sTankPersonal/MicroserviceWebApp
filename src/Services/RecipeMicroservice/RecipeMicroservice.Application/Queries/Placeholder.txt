If you wish an additional layer of abstractions, queries can be created here.
A query is a request for data retrieval, often encapsulating all necessary parameters for that retrieval and receiving a response containing the requested data.
The Service layer will call the correct query to perform the data retrieval.
However, if the data retrieval is simple enough, it can be performed directly in the Service layer without needing a separate query.
