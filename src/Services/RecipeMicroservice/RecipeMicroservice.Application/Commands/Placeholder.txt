If you wish an additional layer of abstractions, commands can be created here.
A command is a request for an action to be performed, often encapsulating all necessary information for that action and receiving a void or status response(bool).
The Service layer will call the correct command to perform the action.
However, if the action is simple enough, it can be performed directly in the Service layer without needing a separate command.
